## xclm replacement
This is a replacement of the Microchip license server (xclm) for the XC8/XC16 and ??? compiler.

## Why?
Learing of some license and anti cracking mechanism.
But main reason is [Microchip forum](http://www.microchip.com/forums/FindPost/707298)

## Compile
Needs cmake and a modern C++11 compiler. Used editor was QtCreator. Simply import this project and start learning.

## Usage
Run xclm --help for command line options. This version works with XC8 1.35. Later version can be patch by running --tryrun and --patchunknown . This is known to work on version 1.36 of xc8 compiler.
